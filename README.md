# (Elmer's) glue stick holder for OpenBeam based printers

This is a glue stick holder that is designed to attach to a 1515 extrusion
(OpenBeam; YMMV with others). For use with a 3d printer that uses PVA glue for bed adhesion and
has a 1515 extrusion to attach this to (like a Kossel Pro).

There is a screw hole for a more secure affixment, but i've only briefly tested
fitment, and it is sort of unnecessary in day-to-day use.
